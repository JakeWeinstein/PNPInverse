\section*{Weekly Focus}
This week focused on converting the inverse workflow from isolated scripts into a modular framework, then building a new experiment-style inference path for Robin boundary transfer coefficients from \(\phi_{\mathrm{applied}}\)-vs-steady-flux data.

The center of gravity was the new Robin curve inference path: data generation, steady-state detection, adjoint gradient extraction point-by-point, SciPy-based optimization, and recovery logic for forward-solve failures.

\section*{Outline of What Was Implemented}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Unified inverse interface that can plug into compatible forward solvers and infer multiple parameter targets.
\item Always-resilient optimization logic that can recover from nonlinear forward-solve failures.
\item Robin experimental pipeline where the observable is steady-state flux on the Robin boundary.
\item New gradient-based Robin \(\kappa\) inference from flux-curve mismatch using Firedrake adjoints + SciPy.
\item Current-density-proxy inference branch using charge-weighted flux \(\sum_i z_i F_i\), with Faraday scaling intentionally omitted pending unit calibration.
\item Regenerated report set for 0\%, 2.5\%, and 5\% noise in both data-generation and inference-fit formats, plus a 2.5\% convergence GIF artifact.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{1. Unified Inverse Interface}
\subsection*{What was built}
A shared inference core was established so new inverse problems can be configured through:
\begin{itemize}
\item a forward-solver adapter,
\item a parameter target definition,
\item a request object containing true value, initial guess, noise, and optimizer settings.
\end{itemize}

This unifies diffusion, Dirichlet BC, and Robin BC inference under one architecture while preserving compatibility wrappers for existing helper imports.

\subsection*{Mathematical template}
For state \(u(m)\) produced by the forward solve under control/parameter \(m\), the generic objective template is:
\[
J(m)=\frac12\int_\Omega \|\mathcal{O}(u(m)) - d\|^2\,dx,
\]
where \(\mathcal{O}\) selects the measured field(s) (concentration, potential, or derived observable), and \(d\) is synthetic/experimental target data.

\section*{2. Resilient Optimization for Forward-Solve Failures}
\subsection*{What was built}
The optimization loop was made always-resilient by adding staged recovery rather than hard-failing on the first diverged PDE solve. Recovery phases were implemented in this order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Increase \texttt{snes\_max\_it}.
\item Apply anisotropy reduction to the trial parameter vector (with reset of relaxed tolerances).
\item Relax nonlinear/linear tolerances (\texttt{snes\_atol}, \texttt{snes\_rtol}, \texttt{ksp\_rtol}) and line-search strategy.
\end{enumerate}

The restart logic uses the last known feasible parameter state, so retries do not repeatedly jump back to the original initial guess.

\subsection*{Anisotropy reduction concept}
For a multi-component parameter vector \(m\), anisotropy is treated as a max/min magnitude ratio. If too large, the vector is blended toward an isotropic surrogate based on geometric-mean magnitude:
\[
m_{\mathrm{new}}=(1-\beta)m + \beta m_{\mathrm{iso}},
\]
where \(\beta\in[0,1]\) controls flattening strength.

\section*{3. Robin Experimental Flux Pipeline}
\subsection*{What was built}
A new workflow mirrors an experiment where:
\begin{itemize}
\item control input is applied voltage \(\phi_{\mathrm{applied}}\),
\item measured output is steady-state flux through the Robin boundary.
\end{itemize}

Utilities were added for:
\begin{itemize}
\item steady-state probe sweeps,
\item synthetic \(\phi_{\mathrm{applied}}\)-flux data generation,
\item CSV serialization and reuse across fitting runs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Steady-state flux definition}
The Robin boundary law in this implementation is:
\[
J_i\cdot n = \kappa_i(c_i-c_{\infty,i}).
\]
Species flux across the Robin electrode boundary is assembled as
\[
F_i = \int_{\Gamma_{\mathrm{electrode}}} \kappa_i(c_i-c_{\infty,i})\,ds.
\]
The default scalar observable used this week is total species flux:
\[
F_{\mathrm{obs}} = \sum_i F_i.
\]

\subsection*{From Modeled Flux to Experimental Current Density}
Experimentally, the directly measured quantity is typically current density
\((\mathrm{mA}/\mathrm{cm}^2)\), not molar flux. In this workflow, the key relation is:
\[
\text{charge-weighted flux} \;\propto\; \sum_i z_i F_i,
\]
so to move from total species flux to a current-like observable, we weight each
species contribution by its charge and sum.

If physical current density units are needed, this weighted sum is then scaled
by constants (Faraday factor and boundary-area conversion). For fitting, the
important structural step is the charge weighting itself.

\textbf{Current implementation note (temporary):}
the new current-density inference branch currently omits the Faraday factor on
purpose and fits a charge-weighted flux proxy \(\sum_i z_i F_i\) in arbitrary
units. This keeps curve magnitudes in the same \(\mathcal{O}(1)\) range as the
flux-based studies while unit conventions are being finalized. Therefore, the
present proxy scaling is not yet a physically calibrated
\(\mathrm{mA}/\mathrm{cm}^2\) mapping.

\subsection*{Steady-state criterion}
At each time step \(n\), with per-species boundary flux \(F_i^{(n)}\):
\[
\Delta_i^{(n)} = |F_i^{(n)}-F_i^{(n-1)}|,
\]
\[
\text{rel}^{(n)} = \max_i\frac{\Delta_i^{(n)}}{\max(|F_i^{(n)}|,|F_i^{(n-1)}|,\varepsilon_{\mathrm{abs}})},
\quad
\text{abs}^{(n)} = \max_i\Delta_i^{(n)}.
\]
A step is steady if
\[
\text{rel}^{(n)}\le\varepsilon_{\mathrm{rel}}
\quad\text{or}\quad
\text{abs}^{(n)}\le\varepsilon_{\mathrm{abs}},
\]
and steady state is declared after the required number of consecutive steady steps.

\subsection*{How \(\kappa\) Shapes the \(\phi_{\mathrm{applied}}\)-Flux Curve}
To isolate \(\kappa\)-dependence, a no-noise overlay was generated for:
\[
\kappa \in \{[2,2], [1,1], [2,1], [1,2], [1,5], [5,1]\}.
\]

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.88\textwidth]{assets/robin_kappa_no_noise_overlay.png}
\caption{No-noise \(\phi_{\mathrm{applied}}\)-vs-steady-flux curves for multiple Robin \(\kappa\) pairs.}
\end{figure}

Interpretation from these curves:
\begin{itemize}
\item Increasing both \(\kappa\) values raises the overall flux level (e.g. \([1,1]\rightarrow[2,2]\)).
\item The two species do not affect voltage sensitivity equally: \([1,5]\) is much steeper than \([5,1]\), even though both have similar zero-voltage flux intercept.
\item This asymmetry is consistent with charge-coupled transport in PNP: each species-specific Robin transfer coefficient multiplies a concentration field that responds differently to applied voltage.
\end{itemize}

Using endpoint slope \(\big(F(0.04)-F(0)\big)/0.04\), representative values are:
\[
[1,1]\!:\!1.984,\quad [2,2]\!:\!1.782,\quad [2,1]\!:\!1.290,\quad
[1,2]\!:\!2.400,\quad [1,5]\!:\!2.942,\quad [5,1]\!:\!0.144.
\]

\section*{4. Robin \(\kappa\) Inference from Flux Curves}
\subsection*{What was built}
A dedicated script and helper pipeline were implemented for inferring \(\kappa\) from a full \(\phi_{\mathrm{applied}}\)-vs-steady-flux curve.

Per voltage point \(\phi_j\), a steady-state forward solve is run and compared to target flux \(F_j^\star\).

\subsection*{Objective and gradient}
Per-point loss:
\[
L_j(\kappa)=\frac12\left(F_j(\kappa)-F_j^\star\right)^2.
\]
Global loss over \(m\) sweep points:
\[
J(\kappa)=\sum_{j=1}^m L_j(\kappa).
\]

Firedrake adjoint is used at each point to compute
\[
\nabla_\kappa L_j(\kappa),
\]
and gradients are accumulated over converged points:
\[
\nabla J(\kappa)=\sum_{j\in\mathcal{C}} \nabla_\kappa L_j(\kappa).
\]

\subsection*{SciPy minimize pipeline}
SciPy receives:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{fun}: curve loss \(J(\kappa)\),
\item \texttt{jac}: analytic adjoint gradient \(\nabla J(\kappa)\),
\item bounds on \(\kappa\),
\item method/tolerance/options (e.g. \texttt{L-BFGS-B}, \texttt{ftol}, \texttt{gtol}, \texttt{maxiter}),
\item callback for iteration diagnostics and plot updates.
\end{itemize}

\section*{5. Noise Model Clarification}
Noise is Gaussian with standard deviation tied to RMS signal magnitude:
\[
\sigma = \left(\frac{p}{100}\right)\mathrm{RMS}(F_{\mathrm{clean}}),
\]
where \(p\) is \texttt{noise\_percent}.

So \(5\%\) means \(\sigma=0.05\cdot\mathrm{RMS}\), not a hard \(\pm 5\%\) pointwise cap. Individual points can exceed \(5\%\) in magnitude.

An analogous set of plots was generated for the current-density inference path.
In this revision, the observable is the charge-weighted flux proxy
\(\sum_i z_i F_i\) (Faraday scaling intentionally omitted), so the y-axis is in
arbitrary units. The objective and optimizer are unchanged.

\section*{7. Practical Takeaways from This Week}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Robin flux-based inverse workflow is now fully implemented end-to-end and experimentally interpretable.
\item A parallel current-density-proxy path is now in place: charge weighting is enforced, while absolute current scaling is explicitly deferred until unit calibration is finalized.
\item The unified interface significantly reduced duplication and made target/solver swapping straightforward.
\item Resilient retry mechanics now handle many nonlinear solve failures that previously aborted optimization.
\item Regenerated proxy runs show strong recovery at 0\% and 2.5\% noise, with expected degradation and basin sensitivity at 5\% noise.
\item Reporting artifacts are now synchronized with the new branch: side-by-side data-generation plots, per-noise fit plots, summary table, and a 2.5\% convergence GIF.
\end{itemize}
